Memory: Assignment # 6
Purpose: The purpose of this program is to implement a list class
using a queue.The list will contain 4 virtual funtions that must be 
implemented,these include store() to store an element, retrieve() to
retrieve a value from the list, empty() to tell us if a list is empty 
and full() to determine if the list is full.

Comments: It doesn't compile with the queue :/ I couldn't figure out how to refer 
the first element in the list to write the pop method for the queue.
